# System Requirements: Lightweight, Flexible, and Powerful
MoarTube is designed to be lightweight and accessible, making it the most resource-efficient self-hosted video and live streaming solution available today.

## üìã **Minimal Requirements**
- **Node.js** is the only requirement to run a MoarTube Node, and it's supported on all major operating systems.
- MoarTube Node **efficiently** operates on even the most resource-constrained systems.
  - Runs comfortably on a VPS with 1GB RAM and 1 vCPU.
  - Can run on a [**Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/).
- Compatible with **Node.js v20 and later**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Resource Efficiency**
- **MoarTube Node's** footprint is remarkably small because most computationally heavy tasks, like encoding and memory-intensive operations, are performed on your local machine by the **MoarTube Client**.
- Your node's responsibilities are **storage and distribution**, keeping its resource demands low so that it can run on just about anything.
- MoarTube Node is **multi-threaded**, utilizing the full potential of its system's CPU to ensure optimal operation.

## üåê **Decentralize your Deployment**
- Designate external providers such as **Postgres** and **S3** to store and distribute your content for greater scalability.
- Your node becomes completely disposable. Content and metadata are stored **externally** (e.g., S3, Postgres), allowing you to re-deploy your node at any time without data loss. Just tell your new node where its data is and you're back **online**.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.moartube.com/guides/how-to-enable-cloudflare-cdn) eliminates much of the strain on your storage distribution by leveraging the **world‚Äôs largest CDN**, giving your node the same global delivery reach as **major platforms**.

## üåç Run Your Node Anywhere
Whether on a cloud VPS, personal computer, or compact device like a Raspberry Pi, MoarTube gives you full control. MoarTube‚Äôs efficiency and flexibility make it the ideal solution for hosting media **anywhere**, on virtually **any hardware**, for audiences of **any size**.

# Prerequisites

Observe the corresponding prerequisite for your installation method.

## Docker
If you're using Docker, make sure that it is installed on your machine.

## npm
If you're using npm to install the software, make sure that [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed on your machine.

## git
You can clone the repo, but make sure that [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed on your machine.

## script (Ubuntu Linux)

A script to automate your entire setup. Installs Node.js using Snap, clones the git repo using git, installs dependencies using npm, and sets the node to autostart on system boot using systemctl

# Installation Methods

Choose any of the following installation methods.

## [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/moartube/moartube-node/tags)

MoarTube Node is available on DockerHub and can be easily set up using Docker Desktop or via the command line for a more manual approach.

### Using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

You can manage MoarTube Node using Docker Desktop by searching for `moartube/moartube-node` on DockerHub within the Docker Desktop interface.

### Manual Docker Setup

To set up MoarTube Node manually using Docker, execute the following command in your terminal. This command pulls the latest MoarTube Node image, creates a container named `moartube-node-1`, assigns it port 8181, and configures it to auto-restart unless manually stopped.

#### For x86-64 architecture: 
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8181:80 --name moartube-node-1 moartube/moartube-node:latest
```

#### For ARM64 architecture: 
```bash
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8181:80 --name moartube-node-1 moartube/moartube-node:latest
```

*note: the Docker container uses [**/data**](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node/blob/master/Dockerfile#L19) for its volume container path.*

## [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moartube/moartube-node)
You can install MoarTube Node globally:

```bash
npm i @moartube/moartube-node -g
```

And run from the command-line globally:

```bash
moartube-node
```

<br>

You can install MoarTube Node locally:

```bash
npm i @moartube/moartube-node
```

And run from the command-line locally:

```bash
node node_modules/@moartube/moartube-node/moartube-node.js
```

## [git](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node
```

Open a terminal in the cloned directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
node moartube-node.js
```

## [script (Ubuntu Linux)](https://www.moartube.com/bash/install/node)

```bash
bash <(wget -O - https://www.moartube.com/bash/install/node)
```

# Next Steps

## Default Login Credentials

The default login credentials for your node are below. Be sure to change these upon logging in.

By default, MoarTube Node listens on port 80.

**username**: admin<br/>**password**: admin

## Cloudflare

At this point, you should probably look into creating a free [Cloudflare account](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) so that you can [give your node CDN capabilities](https://www.moartube.com/guides/how-to-enable-cloudflare-integration). With its global network, Cloudflare will distribute most of your node's videos and live streams.

## Get MoarTube Client

If you haven't already, it's time to get the [MoarTube Client](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Client).
