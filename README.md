## System Requirements

Node.js is the only requirement to run a MoarTube Node, and all major operating systems support it.

MoarTube Node has the smallest resource usage footprint out of any self-hosted video and live streaming solution available today; most of the heavy computational responsibilities and memory-intensive operations are handled by MoarTube Client; MoarTube Node is only responsible for storage and distribution. MoarTube Node is also multi-threaded, utilizing the full potential of the CPU of whatever system it is installed on.

On Digital Ocean, an $8 VPS (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM) provides a comfortable headroom to handle surprisingly moderate demand. Although this tier is likely adequate for most users, others will need to observe the resource usage monitor and adjust their instance accordingly. Or just simply forget all that and [host from your personal computer over home WiFi](https://www.moartube.com/guides/how-to-run-node-on-home-wifi).

The node software uses about 100MB of RAM while sitting idle with fluctuations depending on visitor (and user) demand. Much of the demand can be alleviated by the [Cloudflare integration](https://www.moartube.com/guides/how-to-enable-cloudflare-integration) feature, leveraging the world's largest CDN to distribute your video and live stream data, giving your node capabilities that rival that of major platforms.

To give you an idea of how tiny MoarTube Node really is, the software can run on a [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) on Raspberry Pi OS with approximately 100MB of system RAM remaining out of a total system availability of 512MB; the OS uses about 200MB RAM and reserves an additional 100MB for a swap file.

As you can see, MoarTube Node is quite capable and can run on just about anything, anywhere.

Node.js v20 and later required.

## Prerequisites

Observe the corresponding prerequisite for your installation method.

### Docker
If you're using Docker, make sure that it is installed on your machine.

### npm
If you're using npm to install the software, make sure that [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed on your machine.

### git
You can clone the repo, but make sure that [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed on your machine.

### script (Ubuntu Linux)

A script to automate your entire setup. Installs Node.js using Snap, clones the git repo using git, installs dependencies using npm, and sets the node to autostart on system boot using systemctl

## Installation Methods

Choose any of the following installation methods.

### [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/moartube/moartube-node/tags)

MoarTube Node is available on DockerHub and can be easily set up using Docker Desktop or via the command line for a more manual approach.

#### Using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

You can manage MoarTube Node using Docker Desktop by searching for `moartube/moartube-node` on DockerHub within the Docker Desktop interface.

#### Manual Docker Setup

To set up MoarTube Node manually using Docker, execute the following command in your terminal. This command pulls the latest MoarTube Node image, creates a container named `moartube-node-1`, assigns it port 8181, and configures it to auto-restart unless manually stopped.

##### For x86-64 architecture: 
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8181:80 --name moartube-node-1 moartube/moartube-node:latest
```

##### For ARM64 architecture: 
```bash
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8181:80 --name moartube-node-1 moartube/moartube-node:latest
```

*note: the Docker container uses [**/data**](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node/blob/master/Dockerfile#L19) for its volume container path.*

### [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moartube/moartube-node)
You can install MoarTube Node globally:

```bash
npm i @moartube/moartube-node -g
```

And run from the command-line globally:

```bash
moartube-node
```

<br>

You can install MoarTube Node locally:

```bash
npm i @moartube/moartube-node
```

And run from the command-line locally:

```bash
node node_modules/@moartube/moartube-node/moartube-node.js
```

### [git](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Node
```

Open a terminal in the cloned directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
node moartube-node.js
```

### [script (Ubuntu Linux)](https://www.moartube.com/bash/install/node)

```bash
bash <(wget -O - https://www.moartube.com/bash/install/node)
```

## Next Steps

### Default Login Credentials

The default login credentials for your node are below. Be sure to change these upon logging in.

By default, MoarTube Node listens on port 80.

**username**: admin<br/>**password**: admin

### Cloudflare

At this point, you should probably look into creating a free [Cloudflare account](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) so that you can [give your node CDN capabilities](https://www.moartube.com/guides/how-to-enable-cloudflare-integration). With over 300 data centers worlwide, Cloudflare will distribute most of your node's videos and live streams.

### Get MoarTube Client

If you haven't already, it's time to get the [MoarTube Client](https://github.com/MoarTube/MoarTube-Client).
